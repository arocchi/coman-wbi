First version of coman-wbi
For the moment this is just an example of using Robotran to get J(q), g(q) and fkine.
A planar (sagittal plane) 5R version of CoMaN is implemented by using Robotran symbolic expressions for Jacobian and direct kinematics

It can be extended to implement Andrea del Prete's WBI, and will provide both kinematics and dynamics functionalities for the CoMaN robot.

@TODO
- add Ikfast
- implement WBI interface
